      <description>MDH has created a 12-minute video for health care providers on HPV vaccine communication. The video begins with humorous vignettes and then presents four model clinical encounters in which providers demonstrate low-stress ways of recommending HPV vaccine and answering questions from patients and parents. Each of the model encounters can also be viewed individually.

      <description>Hawaii Chapter is a forum for member ideas, concerns and communication that impact you at the local as well as national level.
Advocacy HAAP is actively examining the needs of the children we treat as well as the needs of the pediatricians in our community. We have sought to establish dialogue and credibility with those that set health care policy. By joining the chapter one can more effectively participate in making the concerns of pediatricians known and contribute to the work needed to change our health care environment so that we can continuously push to deliver health care for children in a more optimal manner.</description>

# Who We Are
The Chapter is a voluntary organization of over 300 members in private, group, military and academic practice as well as pediatricians in training and other non-pediatric physicians interested in Child Health issues.

# What We Stand For

Our mission of the Hawaii Chapter is to attain optimal physical, mental and social health and well-being for infants, children, adolescents and young adults. We will accomplish this mission by addressing the needs of children, their families and their communities, and by supporting Chapter members through advocacy, education, research, service and improving the systems through which they deliver pediatric care.

The Chapter will work together with the national AAP, the Hawaii Medical Association, the County Medical Societies, State and County governmental agencies, health care facilities and organizations, and other organizations and individuals interested in the health and well being of Hawaii’s children.

# What We Are Up To

The Chapter holds dinner meetings sharing news from the AAP and local topics of interest to Pediatricians. Two half-day conferences are held in the Spring and the Fall.  CME is offered.

Chapter members represent the interests of children and their doctors on numerous committee and boards, in State government (such as DOE and DOH) as well as in public/private coalitions.

# Who We Are
The Chapter is a voluntary organization of over 300 members in private, group, military and academic practice as well as pediatricians in training and other non-pediatric physicians interested in Child Health issues.

# What We Stand For

Our mission of the Hawaii Chapter is to attain optimal physical, mental and social health and well-being for infants, children, adolescents and young adults. We will accomplish this mission by addressing the needs of children, their families and their communities, and by supporting Chapter members through advocacy, education, research, service and improving the systems through which they deliver pediatric care.

The Chapter will work together with the national AAP, the Hawaii Medical Association, the County Medical Societies, State and County governmental agencies, health care facilities and organizations, and other organizations and individuals interested in the health and well being of Hawaii’s children.

# What We Are Up To

The Chapter holds dinner meetings sharing news from the AAP and local topics of interest to Pediatricians. Two half-day conferences are held in the Spring and the Fall.  CME is offered.

Chapter members represent the interests of children and their doctors on numerous committee and boards, in State government (such as DOE and DOH) as well as in public/private coalitions.

# Chapter Facts
I already belong to the National AAP, why should I become a member of the Hawaii Chapter?

Hawaii Chapter is a forum for member ideas, concerns and communication that impact you at the local as well as national level.


Advocacy

HAAP is actively examining the needs of the children we treat as well as the needs of the pediatricians in our community. We have sought to establish dialogue and credibility with those that set health care policy. By joining the chapter one can more effectively participate in making the concerns of pediatricians known and contribute to the work needed to change our health care environment so that we can continuously push to deliver health care for children in a more optimal manner.
